# Radiarch validation run 20261106-013131-55ab566

RESEARCH USE ONLY. NOT FOR CLINICAL USE. Radiarch is a research treatment-planning system; its plans, doses and evaluations must not be used to treat patients.

The cases ran one per process from commit 55ab566: `mco_front_tg119` (20261106-013131).

| Case | Status | Time (s) | Checks |
|---|---|---|---|
| mco_front_tg119 | **pass** | 6514.4 | 8 pass, 0 fail, 32 informative |

## mco_front_tg119 — pass

- note: the deliverable plan's dose is recomputed by the engine from its sequenced apertures; TG-119's institutional results are deliverable plans too
